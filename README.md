# nba-projections

Project to practice pandas python module using nba statistics with the goal to accurately project future statistics.
This project is to practice concepts for a larger scale web based project that will involve data analysis on nba statistics.

Steps taken in this projection model include:
- normalizing player data
- finding similiar statistical seasons in nba history
- ranking and weighting player's season stats
- looking at the following seasons of players with similar statistical seasons and using weighted averages to predict the player's next season
- rinse and repeat for multiple players

Afterwards the projection model can be compared to the real data to determine accuracy
